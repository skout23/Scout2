AWS Scout2
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nccgroup/Scout2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nccgroup/Scout2)

## Description

Scout2 is a security tool that lets AWS administrators assess their environment's
security posture. Using the AWS API, Scout2 gathers configuration data for
manual inspection and highlights high-risk areas automatically. Rather than
pouring through dozens of pages on the web, Scout2 supplies a clear view of the
attack surface automatically.

**Note:** Scout2 is stable and actively maintained, but a number of features and internals may change. As such, please bear with us as we find time to work on, and improve, the tool. Feel free to report a bug with details, request a new feature, or send a pull request.

## Installation

To install Scout2:

	# Clone this repository.
	$ git clone https://github.com/nccgroup/Scout2

	## for normal local install
	# install required packages:
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt

	## for lambda function deployment prep
	# install required packages to the vendor directory
	$ pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt -t vendor/

## Requirements

### Python                                                                                           

Scout2 is written in Python and supports the following versions:
 * 2.7
 * 3.3
 * 3.4
 * 3.5

### AWS Credentials                                                                                  
To run Scout2, you will need valid AWS credentials (Access Key). The role, or
user account, associated with this Access Key requires read-only access for all
resources in a number of services, including but not limited to CloudTrail, EC2,
IAM, RDS, Redshift, and S3.

If you are not sure what permissions to grant, the [Scout2-Default](https://github.com/nccgroup/AWS-recipes/blob/master/IAM-Policies/Scout2-Default.json)
IAM policy lists the permissions necessary for a default run of Scout2.

**Note:** If you are running the tool using new credentials, **DO NOT ATTEMPT
TO CREATE YOUR OWN CSV FILE**. Instead, configure your computer using the
[aws_recipes_configure_iam tool](https://github.com/nccgroup/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_recipes_configure_iam.py)
or refer to
[the AWS documenation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-quick-configuration)
for information about configuring credentials for the AWS CLI.

## Usage

### From an EC2 instance with an appropriate IAM role

    $ python Scout2.py

### From a computer configured to use the AWS CLI, boto, or another AWS SDK (default profile)

    $ python Scout2.py

### From a computer configured to use the AWS CLI, boto, or another AWS SDK (other profile)

    $ python Scout2.py --profile <PROFILE_NAME>

### From a computer not configured to use the AWS CLI, using a CSV file downloaded from AWS

To run Scout2 using an access key downloaded from AWS, run the following command:

    $ python Scout2.py --csv-credentials <CREDENTIALS.CSV>

### When MFA-Protected API Access is Enforced

Initiate an STS session using the [aws_recipes_init_sts_session tool](https://github.com/nccgroup/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_recipes_init_sts_session.py)
**OR**
Add the following parameters to your command:

    --mfa-serial <ARN_MFA_SERIAL_NUMBER> --mfa-code <MFA CODE>

To view the report, simply open report.html in your browser.

## Format of the CSV file that contains credentials

AWS allows users to download access keys in a CSV file. If you downloaded the
file from the AWS web console, this should just work. If you were handed
credentials outside of a CSV file, the expected format is as follow (credentials **must** be on line 2):

    User Name,Access Key Id,Secret Access Key (,MFA Serial)
    f00b4r,YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID,YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET (,arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:mfa/f00b4r)

**Note:** The fourth value is not standard, but supported for convenience if you
have enabled MFA-protected API access and want to avoid entering your MFA serial
everytime you run Scout2.

## Advanced documentation

The following command will provide the list of available command line options:

    $ python Scout2.py --help
